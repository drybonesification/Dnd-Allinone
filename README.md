# Dnd project overview

This project was inspired while playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends on the weekends while we all look at our character sheets or some of us have them on our phones, constantly trying to keep in mind who has what, their stats, etc. I wanted something to solve that so this is what this porject aims to do we all can just look at one place and see one anothers stats also some ease of life things for the DM
